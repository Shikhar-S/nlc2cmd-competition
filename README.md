# nlc2cmd

[NLC2CMD Competition](http://nlc2cmd.us-east.mybluemix.net/)

Project to win $2500 by taking over your frustration with bash commands to make a beautiful tool so you don't have to google it. 

## Data

Get the data first:

 * [nl2bash](https://ibm.box.com/v/nl2bash-data)
 * [manpage](https://ibm.box.com/v/nlc2cmd-manpagedata)

and put it in `data/`. There's a Jupyter notebook that helps you. 
Well, at least I hope it helps.
